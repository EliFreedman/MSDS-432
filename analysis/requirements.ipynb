    "In this project, you have been tasked as a full-stack developer to build an application that will be used by data scientists and business analysts for exploratory data analysis and to create different business intelligence reports for the city of Chicago; these reports will be utilized in the strategic planning and the industrial and neighborhood infrastructure investments. The City of Chicago publishes and updates its datasets on its data portal server (https://data.cityofchicago.org/ ) in 16 categories. The 3 categories that this project will utilize for exploratory data analysis and creating the business intelligence reports are: Transportation, Buildings, and Health & Human Services."
